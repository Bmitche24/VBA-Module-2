Module 2 Challenge
The following information had to be completed

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following variables
Ticker Symbol, Yearly Change from opening price at beginning of year to closing price at end of year, percentage change from opening price at beginning of year to closing price at end of year, total stock volume
Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
